# House-Price-Prediction
Data Collection and Preprocessing

Gather data from reliable sources.
Select relevant features (e.g., location, size, amenities).
Clean data (handle missing values, outliers).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand data distribution and correlations.
Visualize relationships between variables.
Feature Selection

Identify highly correlated features with the target variable.
Consider dimensionality reduction techniques if needed.
Model Selection and Training

Split data into training and testing sets.
Choose regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
Train models on the training set.
Model Evaluation

Use metrics like RMSE, MAE to evaluate model performance.
Perform cross-validation to assess generalization.
Model Tuning

Optimize model parameters using techniques like Grid Search.
Prediction and Deployment

Use the trained model to predict house prices.
Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
